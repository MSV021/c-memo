# c-memo
A simple program to create and edit quick memos with text based UI.
This app provides you with a way to take quick notes and create memos right from
terminal without worrying about where to keep the files (no more desktops 
crowded with text files). 

## help 
Creating Memos: Press [C] in menu to create a new memo. After pressing [C] you 
				will be prompted to enter the new memo's title. Leaving this 
				field blank will assign the current date and time to it..
Deleting Memos: Press [X] while highlighting a memo to delete it. Keep in mind 
				that for now there is no prompt and the memo will be deleted 
				immediately.
Text Editor:    Press [ENTER] to select a created memo and start editing it. 
				c-memo uses its own text editor which only supports basic 
				editing features. New data will be saved only if you exit the 
				editor with the [ESC] key. For now there is no way to manually 
				save.

##enjoy!
